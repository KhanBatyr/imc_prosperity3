implementation of Mean Reversion Strategy on options of Volcanick rock stock. 


In round 3 of IMC Prosperity, from the equation derived from Black Scholes model, we calculated implied volatility of options and traded them when they deviated too much from the exponential moving averages. Options with strike prices 9500, 9750 and 10500 had more volatility, than that with 10000 so beta was higher for the former ones. Nevertheless, most profits were made from options with strike price 10000.
